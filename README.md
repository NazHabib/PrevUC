This is PrevUC. A webapp created using python as back-end and python, html and css as front-end. To use python in the back-end it was used the framework Django.    
The main objective of the creation of this webapp where the creation of a neural network that predicts the results of a student. The predictions were trained based on a dataset.    
This was the bachelors degrees final project. This project was designed to create a neural network and a system that is user-friendly. 
This project features 5 types of user: guest, user, professor, data scientist and admin.    
The guest can only predict the results of students.  
THe user can predict the results, save them, give feedback and see notifications.  
The professor can do everything the user can and add data than will or not be used to train future models.  
The data scientist can do everything the user can plus they can create notifications, save the modifications that are made to the models, check the models that are used in terms of parameters and performance, test model parameters and modify the existing models for a better performing one.  
The admin can access all the pages and can access the admin page where they can access to all the data that was created, edit or delete them and create new data.    
As future work the user interface can be modified making a usability test.
